# Permission Restrictions - Final Implementation

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Removed Teacher Write Access to Words
**File:** `backend/routes/words.js`

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
// Teachers could add/edit/delete words directly
POST /api/words (admin, teacher) ❌
PUT /api/words/:id (admin, teacher) ❌
DELETE /api/words/:id (admin, teacher) ❌
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
// Only read access for all authenticated users
GET /api/words (all authenticated users) ✅
GET /api/words/:id (all authenticated users) ✅
// No POST/PUT/DELETE routes exist here!
```

### 2. Added Admin-Only Word Management
**File:** `backend/routes/admins.js`

**NEW Admin Routes:**
```javascript
GET /api/admin/words (admin only) ✅
POST /api/admin/words (admin only) ✅
PUT /api/admin/words/:wordId (admin only) ✅
DELETE /api/admin/words/:wordId (admin only) ✅
```

### 3. Teacher Suggestion System
**File:** `backend/routes/teachers.js`

**Teachers can ONLY:**
```javascript
POST /api/teachers/suggestions (submit word request)
GET /api/teachers/suggestions (view own suggestions)
PUT /api/teachers/suggestions/:id (edit own pending)
DELETE /api/teachers/suggestions/:id (delete own pending)
```

## 🔐 Security Enforcement

### Route-Level Protection
```javascript
// Example: Only admins can add words
router.post('/words', 
  authenticateToken,           // Must be logged in
  authorizeRoles('admin'),     // Must be admin role
  async (req, res) => { ... }
);
```

### Ownership Protection
```javascript
// Teachers can only edit their own suggestions
const suggestion = await WordSuggestion.findById(id);
if (suggestion.suggestedBy.toString() !== req.user.id) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Not authorized' });
}
```

### Status Protection
```javascript
// Can only edit pending suggestions
if (suggestion.status !== 'pending') {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    error: 'Can only edit pending suggestions' 
  });
}
```

## 📝 Testing the Restrictions

### Test 1: Teacher Cannot Add Word Directly
```bash
# Login as teacher
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "teacher@test.com",
  "password": "teacher123"
}

# Try to add word directly (should fail)
POST /api/words
Authorization: Bearer <teacher_token>
{
  "word": "வானம்",
  "meaning_ta": "விண்"
}

# Expected: 404 Not Found
# (Route doesn't exist)
```

### Test 2: Teacher Can Submit Suggestion
```bash
# Submit suggestion (should work)
POST /api/teachers/suggestions
Authorization: Bearer <teacher_token>
{
  "word": "வானம்",
  "meaning_ta": "விண்",
  "meaning_en": "Sky",
  "level": 1
}

# Expected: 201 Created
{
  "message": "Word suggestion submitted...",
  "suggestion": { "status": "pending", ... }
}
```

### Test 3: Teacher Cannot Edit Other Teacher's Suggestion
```bash
# Try to edit another teacher's suggestion
PUT /api/teachers/suggestions/<other_teacher_suggestion_id>
Authorization: Bearer <teacher_token>

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
{ "error": "Not authorized to edit this suggestion" }
```

### Test 4: Admin Can Add Word Directly
```bash
# Login as admin
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@tamilwords.com",
  "password": "Admin@123Tamil"
}

# Add word directly (should work)
POST /api/admin/words
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
{
  "word": "மலை",
  "meaning_ta": "பெரிய குன்று",
  "meaning_en": "Mountain",
  "level": 1
}

# Expected: 201 Created
```

### Test 5: Student Cannot Do Anything With Words
```bash
# Login as student
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "student@test.com",
  "password": "student123"
}

# Can only view words
GET /api/words
Authorization: Bearer <student_token>
# Expected: 200 OK (read-only)

# Cannot submit suggestions
POST /api/teachers/suggestions
Authorization: Bearer <student_token>
# Expected: 403 Forbidden
```

## 🚨 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Cannot POST /api/words"
**Cause:** Route doesn't exist anymore for POST
**Solution:** Teachers must use `/api/teachers/suggestions`

### Error: "Not authorized to edit this suggestion"
**Cause:** Trying to edit another teacher's suggestion
**Solution:** Can only edit own suggestions

### Error: "Can only edit pending suggestions"
**Cause:** Trying to edit approved/rejected suggestion
**Solution:** Once reviewed, suggestions cannot be edited

### Error: "Forbidden"
**Cause:** Wrong role trying to access admin routes
**Solution:** Only admins can access `/api/admin/*` routes

## 📊 Audit Trail

The system now tracks:
- Who suggested the word (`suggestedBy`)
- When it was suggested (`createdAt`)
- Who reviewed it (`reviewedBy`)
- When it was reviewed (`reviewedAt`)
- Current status (`pending`/`approved`/`rejected`)
- Why it was rejected (`rejectionReason`)

This provides complete transparency and accountability.

## 🎉 Summary

✅ **Teachers NO LONGER have direct write access to words database**
✅ **Teachers can only SUGGEST words through approval workflow**
✅ **Only ADMINS can approve suggestions and manage words**
✅ **Complete audit trail for all word additions**
✅ **Security enforced at middleware and route level**
✅ **Proper ownership and status checks**

The system is now properly secured with role-based permissions!
