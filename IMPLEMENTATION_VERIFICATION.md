## 🔄 Complete Workflows Implemented

### ✅ Workflow 1: Teacher Adds Word

3. Admin: `POST /api/admin/suggestions/:id/approve` → Word added to database

### ✅ Workflow 2: Teacher Updates Word
1. Teacher: `POST /api/teachers/word-modifications/update/:wordId` → Creates request (pending)
2. Admin: `GET /api/admin/word-modifications?status=pending` → Views pending
3. Admin: `POST /api/admin/word-modifications/:id/approve` → Word updated in database

### ✅ Workflow 3: Teacher Deletes Word
1. Teacher: `POST /api/teachers/word-modifications/delete/:wordId` → Creates request (pending)

### ✅ Workflow 5: Admin Direct Access

---

## 🔐 Security Implementation ✅

### Route Protection
- ✅ All teacher routes require `authenticateToken` + `authorizeRoles('teacher')`
- ✅ All admin routes require `authenticateToken` + `authorizeRoles('admin')`
- ✅ Word routes (`/api/words`) are read-only (GET only)
- ✅ No write routes for `/api/words` (POST/PUT/DELETE removed)

### Database Control
- ✅ Teachers CANNOT write directly to `words` collection
- ✅ Teachers CAN only create requests (suggestions, modifications)
- ✅ Admin CAN write directly to `words` collection
- ✅ Admin CAN approve/reject all teacher requests
